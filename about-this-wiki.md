# about this wiki

**I've separated this wiki into a couple of different sections:**

## Projects

snippets related to projects I'm working on, including things I'd discuss in actual blog content or hacky things I've put together to prototype different functionality

## Code

Everything "code" related goes here. This includes snippets from different programming languages to more pure development environment stuff inclusind bash scripts, powershell stuff, or figuring out how to squash commits without destroying my entire history and also setting fire to the patio

## Concepts

This is more purely conceptual stuff, likely but not necessarily related to computer science. Pretty much anything that I open in a new tab and tell myself "I'll read this when I'm more focused" goes here.

## Gamedev

All of my stuff game development related; this could be design patterns that I've found apply well to game development or just random things I've learned while messing around with unreal engine or blender.

## Games

It's everything related to playing games. Not that I play games or anything.

## For Fun

it's pronounced GIF!
