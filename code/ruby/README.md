## Installing ruby

### On macOS

use homebrew:

```bash
brew install ruby
```

### On Windows

Ideally, use WSL and refer below to the debian-based distro ruby installation instructions. If you really need to, [install using RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/). Look up RailsInstaller if you want to install Rails with Ruby.

### On Linux

#### Deb

```bash
sudo apt-get install ruby-full
```

#### RPM

```bash
sudo yum install ruby
```
