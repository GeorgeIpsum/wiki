## Installing JavaScript

hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

## Installing TypeScript

Make sure node is installed:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

you can then transpile `.ts` files to javascript using `tsc` on the command line

Or just download vs code. Enjoy life afterwards.
