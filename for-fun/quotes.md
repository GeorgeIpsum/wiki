## about this section

These aren't quotes you'd see on your Momentum dashboard. It's just a hodge podge of random quotes I've found on the internet or through things I've watched, read, or listened to. Some of them are clowney. Please don't think about it too hard!

## quotes from books or poetry

### _Sara Ahmed, The Promise of Happiness_

> There is nothing more vulnerable than caring for someone; it means not only giving your energy to that which is not you but also caring for that which is beyond or outside your control. Caring is anxious—to be full of care, to be careful, is to take care of things by becoming anxious about their future, where the future is embodied in the fragility of an object whose persistence matters. Becoming caring is not about becoming good or nice: people who have “being caring” as their ego ideal often act in quite uncaring ways in order to protect their good image of themselves. To care is not about letting an object go but holding on to an object by letting oneself go, giving oneself over to something that is not one’s own.

### _Callista Buchen, Taking Care_

> I sit with my grief. I mother it. I hold its small, hot hand. I don't say, shhh. I don't say, it's okay. I wait until it is done having feelings. Then we stand and we go wash the dishes.

## quotes from movies

### Anton Ego, Ratatouille

> In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so. But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends.

## quotes from other media

### _dril_

> I will face God and walk backwards into Hel

### _Sheik, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_

> Time passes, people move. Like a river's flow, it never ends. A childish mind will turn to noble ambition.

## anonymous quotes

> You cannot live alone on the fantasies you feed to your mind, eventually you have to touch your life for real, assess and analyze your habits, understand your character, try not to hate yourself for your character as it was shaped when you were very young by circumstances outside of you, and begin learning how to cope with your character, how to build habits that work for you, finish small projects, finish big projects, expose yourself to more uncomfortable situations, assess why you want to leave that friendship before you leave it, raise your anxiety levels on purpose, so that you can grow, raise your work load on purpose, so that you can grow, so that you can build resilience, so that your life expands, and can be experienced by you in full and in reality.



> But what is stopping you? The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.
