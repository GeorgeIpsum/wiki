# hello, world

This is my personal knowledge base: random snippets of information (or perhaps plain junk that I find neat) that I've picked up while browsing the web or reading elsewhere.

## What sort of things are you gonna put here?

Pretty much anything I learn about while reading. Could be random tidbits about developing extensions for web browsers to Pok√©mon meta changes to "oh, so THAT'S how you do that in git."

## Why don't you just use bookmarks?

What's a bookmark.

## Notion????????

**No** thank you! :)
